# Implementation-of-Decision-Tree-Classifier-Model-for-Predicting-Employee-Churn

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the Decision Tree Classifier Model for Predicting Employee Churn.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
 1.import pandas module and import the required data set. 
 
 2.Find the null values and
 count them. 
 
 3.Count number of left values. 
 
 4.From sklearn import LabelEncoder to
 convert string values to numerical values. 
 
 5.From sklearn.model_selection import
 train_test_split. 
 
 6.Assign the train dataset and test dataset. 
 
 7.From sklearn.tree import
 DecisionTreeClassifier. 
 
 8.Use criteria as entropy.
 
 9.From sklearn import metrics.
 
 10.Find
 the accuracy of our model and predict the require values
